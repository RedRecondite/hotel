## What's a Community D-Mod Jam?

A Community D-Mod Jam is a ludum-dare-ish game jam where the Dink Smallwood community collaborated to create a brand new D-Mod within 50 hours.

It used a modified version of Dink Smallwood HD that supported collaborative map editing, where different users could place and edit sprites at the same time.

A [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/C5Qt8PKCObU) is available on Youtube.
